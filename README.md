# CheckIt

Final project from Flatiron school. 

A drag and drop enabled task organizer for children. I chose this is as my project after noticing the struggles that children and parents have had dealing with at home schooling during the pandemic. One of the hardest issues for the children was staying on task and setting and completing goals. There is a confetti explosion whenever a task is checked off because I wanted to make a visual reward for when the kids complete a task. A little celebration so they will want to keep going. 

For drag n drop I used [react-beautiful-dnd ](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)

For the confetti explosion I used [react-dom-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom-confetti)

Styling was done with Material UI, Styled-components and vanilla css. 

On the backend I used Rails and a PostgreSQL database. The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/acasarsa/checkit-api).
