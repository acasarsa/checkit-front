## CheckIt

This repo contains the source code and documentation for my capstone project at the Flatiron School A drag and drop enabled task organizer for children built with React frontend and a RESTful Rails API connection to PostgreSQL database. With children stuck at home during the pandemic I created a web app that would help them keep their days organized and productive.
